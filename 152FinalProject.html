<h1>Phoneme Based Speech Recognition with Neural Networks </h1>

<p> Chris Eriksen and Will Newbury </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Natural Language Processing is a very popular topic in the fields of machine learning and nerual networks. Commonly this problem is approached through the lens of statistical inference and probabilistic reasoning. However, neural networks on their own can do an effective job of classification given single words. Our team intends to expand on this idea in conjunction with a phoneme based method of classification in order to explore word recognition with neural networks. </p>
<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>After research into typical methods of speech classification and recognition, the team decided to take a phoneme based approach to the problem of work recognition. Namely, the team will recognize sound files based on a three step process. Firstly, the data is split into phoneme sections which are then put through spectral analysis in order to extract features that can be put into a neural network. Next, these vectors of fft features are supplied to a multilayer feedforward network trained using scaled conjugate gradient backpropogation. Finally, the sequence of phonemes that is returned from the network is put through probabilistic reconstruction in order to reconstruct the word. </p>
